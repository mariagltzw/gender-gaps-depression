# gender-gaps-depression
This code is to replicate a our paper on the gender depression gap and the role of unequal labor market opportunities.

In this paper, we use the longitudinal g-formula with Monte Carlo integration to perform a dynamic causal decomposition analysis. We perform subgroup analyses by race/ethnicitiy and education. The code for the subgroup analyses can be found in this repository as well.

The data source for this analysis is the Health and Retirement Study which is accessible at (http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/).
